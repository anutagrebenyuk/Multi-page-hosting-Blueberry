    <p>
      Blueberries are sweet, nutritious and wildly popular. Often labeled a
      superfood, they are low in calories and incredibly good for you. 
      <br>
      <strong>The blueberry bush (Vaccinium sect. Cyanococcus)</strong> is a flowering shrub that
      produces berries with a bluish, purple hue â€” also known as blueberries. It
      is closely related to similar shrubs, such as those that produce
      cranberries and huckleberries. 
      <br/>
      
      Blueberries are among the most
      nutrient-dense berries. A 1-cup (148-gram) serving of blueberries contains: 
      
      <ul>
        <li>
Fiber: 4 grams
        </li>
        <li>
Vitamin C: 24% of the RDI
        </li>
        <li>
Vitamin K: 36% of the RDI
        </li>
        <li>
Manganese: 25% of the RDI
        </li>
        <li>
Small amounts of various other nutrients
        </li>
      </ul>  
        They
      are also about 85% water, and an entire cup contains only 84 calories,
      with 15 grams of carbohydrates.
